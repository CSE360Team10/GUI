                        We work with you to manage your patients in an efficient way. Using our unique surveying method, any patient can rate their symptoms and leave specific notes
                        to you about how they are feeling. Our system will automatically determine the severity of their illness based on their responses, and
                        within your profile, list all patients in order of symptom severity. This way, you can see which patients have an urgent status. Its that easy!
