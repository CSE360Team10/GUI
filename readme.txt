To run the website:

Locate and open Homepage.html in your preferred browser. We used Firefox.
Everything runs from that page - login or create a new account to begin using the application.
Account creation is for patient use only.
There is no way to create a doctor's account due to possible security issues. Doctors must get a login created by the system administrator(s), which for the scope of this project, is one of the team members with Firebase access. To test doctor functionality, use the login details below:

Email: doctor@asu.edu
Password: health

There is no configuration required since all account managment is done through Firebase.
